# Responsive Navigation Bar

This mini project is a simple and clean responsive navigation bar built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to explore essential front-end skills like layout structuring, responsive design, internal/external linking, and toggle interactivity.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Exploring

- **Hamburger Menu Toggle**: Iâ€™m implementing a hamburger menu that expands and collapses on smaller screens using JavaScript.
- **Internal & External Links**: At least one link will demonstrate navigation to an internal section and another to an external website.
- **Static Navigation**: The navigation bar remains fixed (static) at the top of the page while the rest of the webpage scrolls.
- **Animations on scroll
- **HighlightING active link based on scroll position
- **Dropdown menus for nested links

## ðŸ“‚ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript
